# Celerio VueJs Quickstart

This VueJS quickstart uses Vue-Cli to create an application skeleton and Celerio 
to **reverse your relational database schema** and **generate** the VueJS + Spring Boot code 
to access your database content. The generated code covers much more areas than a simple Hello World app (search,
pagination, validation, auto-complete, etc.) 

**To generate an application from our sample database, follow the instructions from the [quickstart][] folder.**

Work in progress...
